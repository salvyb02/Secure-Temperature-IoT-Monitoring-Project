# Secure IoT Temperature Monitoring System

## Project Overview
This project implements a **secure temperature monitoring system** using a **Raspberry Pi** and an IoT temperature sensor. Developed in **Java**, the system focuses on **real-time data processing**, **input validation**, and **error handling** to ensure system integrity and reliability.  

Designed as a secure programming project, it demonstrates best practices in validating user inputs, managing concurrent tasks, and maintaining data privacy.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Temperature Monitoring**: Simulates sensor readings and checks for temperature thresholds at regular intervals.
- **Secure Input Validation**: Validates user inputs using **regular expressions (regex)** to prevent misconfigurations.
- **Temperature Conversion**: Supports both Celsius and Fahrenheit inputs, with seamless conversion.
- **Error Handling**: Provides user-friendly error messages and robust handling of invalid input or misconfigurations.
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Includes input validation, range checks, and proper resource management.
